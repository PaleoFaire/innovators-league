Here, using CP-indivisibility as our criterion for non-Markovianity, we study multi-qubit Pauli channels from a single snapshot of the dynamics. We find that while the genera",

Using an effective circuit model capable of describing MPs up to the nonperturbative strong-coupling regime, we show that chaotic and frequency-comb-like behaviors of MPs emerge at the original modes crossing point. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the Kerr nonlinearity induces a finite excitation gap in the soft-mode, particularly ",

The rotation splits the linearly polarized Alfven wave into two circularly polarized magneto-Coriolis waves, one of which exhibits a lower frequency than the original Alfven wave. We find that this low-frequency magneto-Coriolis wave is always unstable in the presence of even a weak chiral vortical effect. This instability may enable new dynamo mechanism applic",

    "summary": "This paper demonstrates the implementation and validation of a microwave testbed for directionally modulated transmission. Directional modulation enables multiple communication and/or radar signals to be transmitted in multiple directions simultaneously using a single phased array aperture, helping to relieve spectral congestion. A two-element transmitter array is driven by a Xilinx ZCU208 Radio Frequency System on a Chip (RFSoC). Our testbed provides a foundation for developing a fully reconfig",

Similarly to barrier certificates, recent works explore the notion of closure certificates, a form of transition invariants, to verify dynamical systems against $\u03c9$-regular properties including safety.

The security of the system, therefore, may be overestimated. To address this gap, we introduce a market model with a social-welfare-based day-ahead market clearing mechanism.",
