    "abstract": "Sunflowers, daisies, and their relatives belong to a family of plants that make up ca. 10% of flowering plant biodiversity and include numerous species of horticultural, medicinal, and industrial value. This group of flowering plants also contains economically important food crops including artichoke, lettuce, safflower, and sunflower. It is considered one of the most successful plant families due to its large size and global distribution. Key to the success of the family is its inflorescence (a",
